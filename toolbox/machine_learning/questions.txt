1. What is the general trend in the curve?
	As the percentage of data used for training becomes greater and greater, accuracy on test set increases linearly.

2. Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others?  Why?
	Yes, there are parts that appear to be noisier than others. However, these parts are different every time. Therefore, the noise are possibly generated by variability.

3. How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve?
	The curve is largely smooth at 100 trials. 

4. Try different values for C (by changing LogisticRegression(C=10**-10)).  What happens?  If you want to know why this happens, see this Wikipedia page as well as the documentation for LogisticRegression in scikit-learn.
	Once C is smaller than 10**-18, the accuracy on test set drops to 10 percent when 30 percent of data or more are used for training. When C is bigger or equal to 10**-5, the accuracy increases rapidly as the percentage increases and reaches an incredible 85 percentage with 40 percentage of data used for training.
